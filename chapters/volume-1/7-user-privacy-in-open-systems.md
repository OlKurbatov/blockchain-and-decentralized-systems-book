# User privacy in open system
## 7.1 Privacy as a concept in the digital world
At the beginning of the 21st century, making an online payment was considered risky and was usually done with great 
caution. Using real names on online resources was, at least, strange, and the need for privacy of online activity was 
considered as something by default.

In some countries, the security and well-being of users depend on the degree of protection of their personal data. 
David Crosbie, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, noted that the introduction of truly anonymous payments 
can improve security concerns in the developing countries [99] where public confidence in the legislative, judicial, and 
executive bodies is often very low, and privacy is not always maintained when processing personal data. In developed 
countries, there is often a well-established infrastructure and regulatory framework, ensuring the fundamental 
requirement for information security (such as GDPR).

The subject of privacy and the ways to ensure it is a quite extensive topic, so it would be best to begin with the basic 
definitions.

### Importance of maintaining privacy
In practice, privacy in open systems is of paramount importance. Let's suppose there are five restaurants on one street. 
They compete for the flow of customers and each one strives to earn more revenue. Information about internal pricing 
processes and revenues remains secret from competitors. Let's imagine what would happen if someone were to make 
information about all internal transactions and other documentation of these five restaurants publicly available.

The less successful competitors might be tempted by improper intentions to harm the most successful competitor 
financially by, for example, causing a fire. If the reason for that restaurant being successful and popular with 
customers was its tasty dishes cooked using fresh and quality products, the only parties to benefit from its ruin would 
be the less successful competitors.

The question of privacy is also relevant in the field of scientific research. A group of scientists, having made 
meaningful discoveries, may wish to remain anonymous (as if with Bitcoin); perhaps each of them prefers to be considered 
a part of the team which collectively contributed to the discovery, rather than as an individual. Therefore, anonymity 
and legitimacy of financing of scientific research for the development of independent and censorship-free research 
institutions may reasonably become relevant.

Nowadays analytical capabilities allow companies not only to take into account the habits of users but also to influence 
their behavior. All this has become possible due to the capability to capture and process data on purchases and other 
user activity on the Web. Access to this data can generate huge additional revenues.

A good example is a case involving Target stores where a man complained loudly in the store that his daughter had 
received a large number of coupons for diapers and children's clothing, although she had not even finished school and 
thinking about children at her age would be, pardon, too much. The store manager agreed that it was strange, and 
apologized. However, the girl was actually pregnant, and because of a pregnancy prediction system developed by a Target 
analyst, Andrew Paul, which analyzed purchasing preferences, the store was able to identify the girl's pregnancy much 
earlier than even her father.

This story can evoke all sorts of different emotions, but most likely people would not be happy to discover that a 
significant part of their purchases can be influenced. Moreover, if you analyze the data received and used for these 
purposes, a lot of it may prove to be personal data. If you consider that an individual did not give consent to the 
processing of their personal data, it is reasonable to assume that they may feel deceived. It is most likely that people 
would want to restrict access to their personal data to protect themselves from companies that may wish to manipulate 
customers' purchasing behavior, targeting them with well-timed "advantageous offers".

Therefore, one of the most important topics to consider is privacy in the digital world. Considering the development of 
technology and analytical tools, this question is becoming more and more relevant.

### Components of privacy
The concept of privacy includes two main components: *untraceability* and *anonymity*. Untraceability implies the 
inability to attribute a series of actions to a certain user on the network. Anonymity is associated with the inability 
to reliably establish the identity of a user in the network. Figure 7.1 shows an example of how a typical person may 
wish to protect himself and his privacy on the network.

The concept of anonymity implies the presence of both social and technical elements. Social anonymity includes 
information concerning an individual's personal information. Technical anonymity is much more complicated, and the main 
efforts are focused on ensuring anonymity in this area specifically.

When it comes to increasing the level of privacy, special mechanisms can be provided to protect the following attributes 
of user activity:
* Direct association between actions, messages, and transactions 
* Versions of applications and operating system 
* Localization of applications 
* Timestamps of messages and requests 
* Identifiers (usernames, email addresses, phone numbers)
* Fact of an action 
* Device locations 
* Network addresses of devices

Some implementations of Tor browser and BitTorrent client have already been supporting advanced privacy options that 
help to protect some of the listed attributes. The techniques can indeed be specific: for example, using random ports on 
a network level, high redundancy of requests, and changing the default screen resolution.

As we have mentioned before, Bitcoin showed that a financial system can be transparent and auditable to everyone while 
maintaining a certain level of user privacy. Nevertheless, it became clear that for some use cases, the level of 
transparency that blockchain provided is unacceptable. Thus, new methods to provide a higher level of user privacy were 
also proposed and even implemented in some cryptocurrency projects. These methods effectively solved issues of privacy 
for transactions while leaving them immutable and publicly verifiable.
